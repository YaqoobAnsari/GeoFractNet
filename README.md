Perfect 👍 Let’s make a **polished `README.md`** for your GitHub repo that:

* Explains the project and purpose
* Shows the **repo structure** clearly
* Mentions your **U-Net–based model**
* Describes datasets, training/test split, and how to link back to **GeoCrack dataset**
* Explains that **weights and results are tied to the GeoFractNet paper**
* Mentions `images.txt` as a mapping file

Here’s a ready-to-use draft:

# GeoFractNet

**GeoFractNet: A Dilated U-Net with Edge-Aware Skip Connections for the Semantic Edge Detection of Natural Fractures in Outcrop**

This repository accompanies the **GeoFractNet paper** and provides the code, sample results, and data references needed to reproduce and extend the work.  
The model is based on a **U-Net architecture**, enhanced with **dilated convolutions** and **edge-aware skip connections** for improved fracture edge detection performance.

> ⚠️ Note: The folders `Original Images/`, `Edge Binary Masks/`, and `Test Images/` are empty here to keep the repository lightweight.  
> The actual data comes from the **[GeoCrack dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10076740)**.  
> Use the `images.txt` file to map the training and testing images back to the dataset.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [GeoCrack Dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10076740)  
- **Contents:**
  - Original outcrop images  
  - Corresponding binary edge masks  
  - Testing images  

- **Mapping:**  
  The file `images.txt` specifies exactly which GeoCrack images are used for training, validation, and testing in this project.

---

## Model

- **Architecture:** U-Net backbone with:
  - **Dilated convolutions** for improved receptive field  
  - **Edge-aware skip connections** to preserve fracture boundaries  
- **Training:** Configurations are defined in the code under `Code/`.  
- **Weights:** Model weights are not included here due to size.  
  - They will be released alongside the **GeoFractNet paper**.  
  - Check the paper for training details and quantitative results.  

---

## Results

- **Sample Results:**  
  10 sample outputs are included in `Results/Result Images/`.  
- **Full Results and Weights:**  
  Available in the **GeoFractNet paper**. When model weights are released, links will be added here.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YaqoobAnsari/GeoFractNet.git
   cd GeoFractNet
````

2. Prepare environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download dataset from [GeoCrack](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10076740).
   Place the original images, edge masks, and test images into the corresponding folders:

   ```
   Original Images/
   Edge Binary Masks/
   Test Images/
   ```

4. Train or evaluate the model using scripts in `Code/`.

✅ This `README.md` will make your repo look **professional on GitHub**:  
- Clean structure diagram  
- Clear dataset explanation + link to GeoCrack  
- Clear model explanation  
- Explicit note about empty folders & sample results  

Would you like me to also prepare a **`requirements.txt` template** for your Python code (typical deep learning stack: PyTorch, numpy, pandas, etc.), so users can run it right away?
